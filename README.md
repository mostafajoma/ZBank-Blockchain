## Background
ZBank is a small, innovative bank that is interested in exploring what
blockchain technology can do for them and their customers.

This project is to set up a private blockchain testnet for the team of developers so we
can use to explore potentials for blockchain at ZBank.

I have decided on setting up a testnet because:
There is no real money involved, which will give our team of developers the freedom to experiment.
Testnets allows for offline development.


Tokens inherently have no value here, so we will provide pre-configured accounts and nodes for easy setup.
I have created documentation for other developers on how to start it using the pre-configured
nodes and accounts.
